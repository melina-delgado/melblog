Hello, world!

My name is Melina Delgado, and I built this blog to document my learnings, whether it is related to software, home improvement, or other personal projects. I naturally document my life privately, but hopefully by sharing it, it can help others.

There's more to come, but for now, enjoy this photo of the flower lilies I captured at the Seattle Japanese Garden during my visit this past summer.

Until next time,
Melina
